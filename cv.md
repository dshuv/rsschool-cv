## Code Example
Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

`function reverseWords(str) {
  return str.split(" ").map((el) => el.split("").reverse().join("")).join(" ");
}`


## English-language
At the moment I rate my level of English as A2, as there has been no practice for a long time.
The language practice was , since I was in Europe for quite a long period of time , at the same time I was took a course at the B1 level, but due to personal problems I had to leave it almost a month before graduation.
