## Personal information
My main goal at the moment is to become part of the **EPAM** team and to implement the skills that I have and will get as a result of this course.
I am communicative, responsive and hard-working. I am not afraid of any difficulties and perceive them as, a new challenge that will only make me stronger in any aspect. That’s why I consider myself to be stressed-out.
I don’t have a commercial experience, but I’ve always tried to realize my own ideas for a working application. That’s why I want to gain this experience and upgrade my skills through this course.


## Skills
HTML&CSS, JS, Typescript, React, NextJs, OOP, DRY, GIT, GitHub, GitLab, VSCode, WebStorm.

## Education 
Secondary Special Education

## Code Example
Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

`function reverseWords(str) {
  return str.split(" ").map((el) => el.split("").reverse().join("")).join(" ");
}`


## English-language
At the moment I rate my level of English as A2, as there has been no practice for a long time.
The language practice was , since I was in Europe for quite a long period of time , at the same time I was took a course at the B1 level, but due to personal problems I had to leave it almost a month before graduation.
